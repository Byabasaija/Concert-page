This project is the capstone project of in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse. The Main goal was to build an online website for an event. I chose an HTML/CSS bootcamp.

I've worked on all the requirements given on this project.

- Used the clients' colours, layouts and design guidelines.
- Aligned some elements with float and flex or grid.
- Used semantic HTML elements for the header, the main content and the footer.
- Styled the elements to look like the given design.
- Used Bootstrap.
